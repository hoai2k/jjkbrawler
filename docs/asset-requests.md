# Asset Requests — open requests

**To DRAW from, use [image-requests.md](image-requests.md), not this file.**
That is the single image-request document for every render mode — this round is
reproduced in it whole, alongside the 3D track's, resolved against what is
actually on disk. This file stays where the sprite rounds are AUTHORED: edit a
round here and re-run `node tools/build_image_requests.mjs`.

Everything in this file is **outstanding**. Delivered rounds are recorded in
[asset-requests-history.md](asset-requests-history.md) — including the round
numbers, so a commit or code comment citing "round 5 art" still resolves.

(This file is 2D art — sprites, cards, effects, backdrops. Requests for the
2.5D path's rigged 3D models live in
[billboards/docs/asset-requests.md](../billboards/docs/asset-requests.md),
numbered B1, B2…; the live-3D anime path's model requests live in
[render3d/docs/asset-requests.md](../render3d/docs/asset-requests.md),
numbered D1, D2…, and its 2D image inputs — turnaround boards for
image-to-3D, face sheets, shade palettes — in
[render3d/docs/image-requests.md](../render3d/docs/image-requests.md),
numbered DI1, DI2… — so the tracks never collide. All of them are gathered into
[image-requests.md](image-requests.md), which is what to read to draw any of
them; these files are where each is written.)

**Current status: rounds 1–21 delivered. Rounds 22 and 23 are open.**
**Both rounds are nearly closed, and all seven staged fighters now have their
art.** Round 22 delivered its three 36-pose sets (22B–22D), the roster teeter,
the effects, the dolls, the cards and Naoya's backdrop (22A, 22E–22H); round 23
delivered four more 36-pose sets, seven effects, Tengen's barrier and four
hero cards, and answered three of 22I's rejects along the way. Both are
[in the history](asset-requests-history.md#round-23--round-24s-four-staged-fighters-delivered).

What is left is **22I** — seven frames, six of them the one wind-up fault
across Yaga's and Naoya's attack pairs, plus `nanami/teeter` — and **23H**,
Miwa's heavy, and a decision about the colour of Tengen's barrier. Nothing is
blocking. **Every one of the seven staged fighters is now drawable** — full
pose set, effects, hero card, and a domain backdrop for the two who have a
domain — so any of them can be promoted whenever their owner says so. A
promoted fighter still owes a `teeter`, which is the one pose 22A did not
cover for them.
Round 21's walk cycle landed complete — 54 sprites, two frames for each of the
twenty-seven — and is
[in the history](asset-requests-history.md#round-21--the-walk-cycle).

**Round 22 is the round to add to** — 19 was used for the intake of round 18 and
is not a request number. Anything found from here goes into 22.

**How the sprite count is derived.** A pose is outstanding if it carries a
workbench flag *or* is drawing a file that is not its own. The second half is
the one that goes missing: a pose rejected at approval is pointed at another
frame of the same set so the game keeps drawing something, and that raises no
flag for `tools/list_replacements.py` to report. Both halves are checked against
the manifest, not against this file — [18C](asset-requests-history.md#18c-three-that-fell-through-the-round-renumbering--3-sprites)
is what the first found and [18G](asset-requests-history.md#18g-seven-a-pose-is-drawing-somebody-elses-art--7-sprites)
is what the second did.

**The approval queue holds round 18's 25 sprites.** Rounds 14, 16 and 17 all
landed through the [approval step](../assets/intake/README.md#the-confirm-step) — a delivery is in
the repo before it is in the game, and each pose is a decision waiting in the
sprite workbench — and every one of those decisions has been made. What a
player sees is what was approved, Hanami's canon set included — round 18's own
decisions are the queue that is open now.

**Kurourushi is shipped.** His 36-pose set, his hero card, his simplified tile
and both his summons landed with round 15; the set was placed and approved pose
by pose, and his key now sits in the Curses group in `src/config_menus.js`, so
`STAGED_CHARACTER_KEYS` in `src/characters.js` is empty for the first time since
round 15. The roster is 27 fighters. What his placement pass found became
**18B**, now delivered.

The roster is complete and **every fighter now has one sprite per action** —
round 11 finished the conversion that round 5 started, so the 4×5 sprite sheet
is retired and no action anywhere plays a grid cell. Nothing outstanding blocks
play.

Read **[pose-brief.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/sprites/docs/pose-brief.md)** before drawing a fighter. It is the
standing brief — what every pose has to be, the four criteria the engine
measures, and the faults that have each cost the roster a re-request — and it is
cumulative, so it is the reason a new set should arrive better than the last one.
This file asks for particular art; that file says what the art has to be.

Read **[the canonical reference image](#the-canonical-reference-image--one-per-fighter)**
below before drawing anything: it names the one image each fighter is matched
against, and it applies to every request in this file. (Summons have no
canonical reference: 16A matches the existing still, and 16B is new design.)

## Where to deliver

**Upload art to `assets/intake/`, never to `sprites/assets/`.**

```
assets/intake/<character>/<pose_key>.png    sprites
assets/intake/effects/<name>.png            technique effects
assets/intake/summons/<name>.png            summon minions
assets/intake/cards/<key>_card.jpg          hero cards
assets/intake/backgrounds/<name>.jpg        stage / domain backgrounds
assets/intake/garnish/<name>.png            near-field cards for ?camera=3d (18F)
```

`sprites/assets/` holds **finished runtime art only** — keyed, trimmed, alpha,
registered in `manifest.json`. Generated art arrives as an untrimmed plate on a
flat colour field with no alpha, so a raw file landing there makes the game try
to draw a 1024×1536 background as a sprite. Every round so far has arrived that
way, so this is the normal case rather than a mistake — it just has to go
through the pipeline first.

`assets/intake/` is tracked by git (only `_processed/` is ignored) so uploading
into it works. Raw files live there until processed, then move to
`assets/reference/round<N>/` as the permanent archive. See
[assets/intake/README.md](../assets/intake/README.md) for the full flow.

## Delivery spec

PNG, **one subject per file**, no text, no watermark, no border, no grids.
(Hero cards are the exception: JPEG, full-bleed background — see round 9A in
the [asset-requests-history.md](asset-requests-history.md).)

- **Background:** a **flat key screen**, solid magenta `#FF00FF` — except
  warm-palette characters (Sukuna, Nobara, Momo, Hakari, Yuji, Choso, Uro and
  Gakuganji), which need mid-grey `#808080`. A magenta key eats pink and red
  tones.

  Our generator **cannot output a true alpha channel** — every delivery is an
  opaque plate on a flat colour field, which is why the repo talks about green,
  magenta and grey screens rather than transparency. So the key screen is not a
  fallback, it is the format, and the transparency in `sprites/assets/` is
  something `tools/intake.py` cuts on import. That makes the *quality of the
  screen* the thing that decides whether a sprite comes out clean: pick a
  screen colour that appears nowhere in the character, keep it perfectly flat
  and unlit, and do not let it bounce colour onto hair or cloth edges. Round 9F
  was a whole request that existed because a screen leaked.
- **Facing:** draw everything **facing RIGHT**. If your generator prefers left,
  say so and it gets batch-mirrored on import.
- **Framing:** full body inside the frame with margin on **all four sides**.
  Nothing may touch the canvas edge.
- **Resolution:** character body **at least 600 px tall**.
- **One zoom per character.** Draw every pose of a character at the same figure
  scale — do not redraw each pose to fill its canvas. Standing poses should
  measure within a few percent of each other; low poses (crouch, roll, run) are
  genuinely shorter. This is the single most expensive thing to fix later: it is
  only catchable by eye, and a mismatch between two frames of the same idle
  makes the character visibly pulse while standing still.
- **Opacity:** bodies 100% opaque; only genuine effects (glow, mist, sound
  waves) may be translucent.

Style suffix — append to every sprite prompt:

> clean Japanese anime key-art style matching the Jujutsu Kaisen TV anime,
> crisp dark lineart, cel shading with soft gradient accents, vibrant colors,
> high detail, full body, no text

Prompt formula: `[CHARACTER BLOCK]`, `[POSE LINE]`, facing right,
`[STYLE SUFFIX]`.

### Directional effects point LEFT

The projectile renderer mirrors a sprite when it travels right, so art drawn
pointing right flies backwards with its blunt end leading. Draw travelling
effects (beams, lances, diving creatures) **pointing left**; `chain.png` and
`crow.png` are the correct references.

---

## Character blocks

Used verbatim as `[CHARACTER BLOCK]` in every prompt below, so a character's
design stays identical across their card, their sprites and any new art.

Use verbatim — these are the established designs, checked against the current
sheets.

**Check the block against the show before drawing.** The authority is the
character's **(Anime)** full-body render on
[jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com), not the block
text and not the art already in the repo. Three blocks below (`uro`, `reggie`,
`gakuganji`) described characters who look nothing like their anime designs,
which is what round **9E** fixed; those three rows were rewritten from the
reference and their old wording is dead. Downloaded copies
of the references live in
[`assets/reference/canon/`](../assets/reference/canon/), with the source URLs
and a recipe for fetching more in that directory's README.

*(The 17 above are the launch roster; the six below shipped in round 7. The
`uro`, `reggie` and `gakuganji` rows were rewritten from the anime reference in
round 9 — see **9E**; art made against their old wording is being replaced. The
four `mechamaru` / `yuki` / `dagon` / `kurourushi` rows are round 15 and were
written from the wiki's **(Anime)** renders, archived in
[`assets/reference/canon/`](../assets/reference/canon/). They were the only
blocks with no delivered art behind them; all four have shipped since, so they
now have a `<char>_idle.png` and are matched against it like everyone else.
The three `kashimo` / `yaga` / `naoya` rows are round 23's staged fighters and
the four `kirara` / `haruta` / `tengen` / `miwa` rows are round 24's, all
written the same way from the renders — the seven are today's only blocks with
no delivered art behind them; see rounds 22B–22H and 23A–23G below.)*

## The canonical reference image — one per fighter

Every request in this file says "match the existing set", and every round so far
has had to work out what that means by opening files. This is the answer, once,
for all of them: **a fighter's `idle_a` is their canonical image.**

Open it before drawing anything else for that fighter, and match its **costume,
proportions, age, palette, line weight and shading**. Where `idle_a` and an
older sheet cell disagree — and they do, in places — `idle_a` wins. It is the
newest full-body art, it is the pose the sprite workbench benchmarks size
against, and it is what the player looks at most.

A rendered copy of each is checked in at
[`assets/reference/canon/`](../assets/reference/canon/), alongside
**`roster_idle.png`** — all twenty-three at matched figure scale on a common
floor line. Look at that one first: it is the only view that shows whether a fighter is
drawn a head too tall, which is the mistake no single-character reference can
catch. The copies are regenerated by `tools/build_canon_reference.py`, so they
keep resolving after a sprite is replaced.

| Fighter | Key | Canonical image |

| Choso | `choso` | `assets/reference/canon/choso_idle.png` |

**Gakuganji, Reggie Star and Uro used to be exceptions** — their old art was a
different character, so their `idle_a` was exactly what must *not* be matched.
Round 9E replaced all three from the **(Anime)** full-body renders on
[jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com), archived in
[`assets/reference/canon/`](../assets/reference/canon/), and their new `idle_a`
is canonical like everyone else's — the table above includes them. The
`<char>_anime.png` wiki renders that seeded those redraws stay in the
directory for design questions, but **prefer the `<char>_idle.png` files when
they exist**: they carry the figure scale, line weight and shading the
delivered set actually has.

**The four round-15 fighters have no `idle_a` at all**, which is the one case
this rule cannot cover: there is nothing to match yet. Their canon is the wiki's
**(Anime)** full-body render, checked in beside everyone else's:

| Fighter | Key | Canonical image |
|---|---|---|
| Dagon | `dagon` | `assets/reference/canon/dagon_anime.png` |
| Kurourushi | `kurourushi` | `assets/reference/canon/kurourushi_anime.png` |
| Mechamaru | `mechamaru` | `assets/reference/canon/mechamaru_anime.png` (plus `mechamaru_absolute_anime.png` for Mode: Absolute) |
| Yuki Tsukumo | `yuki` | `assets/reference/canon/yuki_anime.png` |

**Every fighter on the roster and every staged fighter now has an `idle_a`**,
so the rule above covers all of them without exception — rounds 22 and 23
closed the last gap. The `<char>_anime.png` wiki renders that seeded the seven
staged designs stay in the directory for design questions, but prefer the
`<char>_idle.png` files: they carry the figure scale, line weight and shading
the delivered set actually has.


**Draw each one's `idle_a` first and place it before drawing anything else for
them** — every other pose of that fighter is then matched against their own
idle, exactly like the rest of the roster, and round 7's hardest lesson was that
a new character has no frame to inherit placement from (see
[asset-requests-history.md](asset-requests-history.md#round-7--six-new-fighters)).

**⚠ Hanami is the fourth case, found while round 17 was being written** —
his canon is `assets/reference/canon/hanami_anime.png`, not his `idle_a`. Every
sprite he has draws a **bark-and-foliage tree body**: grey-brown wood grain,
branch spurs off the shoulders, leaves, a flower growing out of a cracked wooden
face. Canon Hanami is a **lean pale humanoid curse** — bone-cream skin under
heavy black stripe markings, a rigid grinning mask-face crowned with tan antler
horns, one arm and shoulder bound in white cloth, black hakama, bare clawed
feet. They are not the same character, so `hanami_idle.png` is exactly what must
*not* be matched, the way the other three were before 9E. His block above was
rewritten from the render at the same time; the old wording is dead.
[17A](asset-requests-history.md#17a-a-full-hanami-set--36-sprites) is the redraw. When its new idle is
picked, re-run `tools/build_canon_reference.py` and `hanami_idle.png` becomes
the authority again like everyone else's.

**Mahoraga's canon is the shikigami render, not his `idle_a`** —
`assets/reference/canon/mahoraga_canon.png`, the full-body art the game already
ships. Round 11A redrew him from it, so his delivered set now agrees with it;
the render stays the authority for his design because it is what the set was
drawn against.

He also has a character block now, which he did not until round 13 came back
with **the karma wheel missing from three poses**. He was the only sprite set in
the game without one, so his prompts carried no design text at all and the
design lived entirely in a reference image — which works when somebody opens it
and fails silently when they do not. A reference image is not a substitute for
the block; it is what the block is checked against.

## Repo work, not a request: the two alpha fixes

`hakari/dodge_air` and `toji/dodge_air` both carry unkeyed grey behind the
figure — a drawn shadow in almost exactly the mid-grey `#808080` of their key
screen. Intake cuts the key by flooding in from the border, and a *shaded* grey
is not the flat key colour, so it survives the cut and hangs in the air behind
them every time they air-dodge.

**Neither is an asset request.** The drawings are good and their placement is
correct; the file is what is wrong, and that is repo work. They are flagged
`wantsImprovement: "alpha"` so the workbench shows them and
`tools/list_replacements.py` tracks them, and they are listed here only so a
round's numbers are not mistaken for the whole outstanding list.

If a redelivery is ever easier than a cut, the spec is the standard one with a
single addition: **no drawn shadow of any kind** — the game casts its own.

# Round 22 — open

## 22I. Seven frames the round-22 boards rejected — 7 sprites

The faults found reviewing round 22 — six from the 22B–22D sprite sets and one
from the teeter. Three more were on this list and are answered: the
`kashimo/special_side` costume and both of Yaga's crouches were redrawn with
round 23 and are
[in the history](asset-requests-history.md#round-23--round-24s-four-staged-fighters-delivered).
Everything else in those deliveries is in the game; these
seven are in it too, drawing what was delivered, and flagged in the workbench so
they are visible while they wait. Same character blocks, same key screens, same
delivery paths as the sets they belong to.

**Six of them are one fault**, and it is the reason the brief now measures the
wind-up: Yaga's and Naoya's `_a` frames were drawn about as extended as their
own strikes. Kashimo's set is not among them — his light and heavy pairs read
correctly, and his aerial pair was drawn correctly and delivered INVERTED,
which was fixed by pointing each pose at the other file rather than by a
redraw. The `_a`
rule in [pose-brief.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/sprites/docs/pose-brief.md) applies to these redraws
too, and both halves of the pair have to pass the ruler.

| File | Fighter | What is wrong, and what to draw |
|---|---|---|
| `naoya/attack_light_a.png` | Naoya | **The wind-up is already the strike.** Drawn mid-blow, so the light attack has no coil and no tell. Redraw as the coil: striking hand drawn back beside the body, shoulders turned away from the target, weight on the back foot, lead arm up as a guard. It must reach **no further forward than `naoya/idle_a.png`** |
| `naoya/attack_heavy_a.png` | Naoya | Same fault. Redraw as the wind-up of one committed blow: fist drawn as far back as the body allows, hips loaded, front foot light — and inside the idle's reach |
| `naoya/attack_air_a.png` | Naoya | Same fault, airborne. Body coiled mid-jump, striking limb cocked, legs gathered — the extension belongs to `attack_air_b` |
| `yaga/attack_light_a.png` | Yaga | Same fault as Naoya's, same fix, against `yaga/idle_a.png` |
| `yaga/attack_heavy_a.png` | Yaga | Same fault. It is standing in on his `guard` frame in the workbench meanwhile, which is a stopgap and not a wind-up — the delivered plate needs redrawing as the coil |
| `yaga/attack_air_a.png` | Yaga | Same fault, airborne |
| `nanami/teeter.png` | Nanami | **Framing.** The pose is right — weight back, arms out, head down toward the drop — but his blunt blade runs off the LEFT edge of the plate and is cut flat by the canvas. The delivery spec's "nothing may touch the canvas edge" rule, and the "reach falls off the canvas" fault the brief has named since round 13. Redraw the same pose with margin on all four sides so the blade finishes inside the frame |

**A promoted fighter owes a teeter.** 22A drew the pose for the roster of 27;
the seven staged fighters were not in it, and until each is promoted their
teeter falls back to their idle frames with the procedural lean `src/motion.js`
supplies — which is what the whole roster did before 22A landed, so nothing is
broken. But promoting one without drawing it leaves that fighter the only one
on the select screen with no teeter drawing, so it belongs in the round that
promotes them: **`teeter` for `kashimo`, `yaga`, `naoya`, `kirara`, `haruta`,
`tengen` and `miwa`**, one sprite each, on the 22A brief.

**Kashimo's canonical reference is now his own idle**, not the wiki render —
36 poses landed, so the rule that governs every other fighter applies to him:

- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/sprites/assets/kashimo/idle_a.png>
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/sprites/assets/naoya/idle_a.png>
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/sprites/assets/yaga/idle_a.png>

## 23H. Miwa's heavy strike — 1 sprite

The one fault found reviewing round 23. Her set is otherwise excellent and all
36 poses are in the game; this frame is in it too, drawing what was delivered,
and flagged in the workbench while it waits.

| File | Fighter | What is wrong, and what to draw |
|---|---|---|
| `miwa/attack_heavy_b.png` | Miwa | **The heavy does not finish bigger than the light.** Both are a level thrust with the blade forward at chest height; measured forward of her own centre they are the same (+0.12 and +0.11 of standing height), and she is the roster's most sword-dependent fighter reaching less far than every unarmed fighter in round 22. Redraw it as a committed cut that TRAVELS — hips rotated through, the blade finishing well past where `attack_light_b` ends. Her canonical reference is now her own idle: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/assets/reference/canon/miwa_idle.png> |

**Not a request, a decision: Tengen's barrier is violet and his kit is
parchment.** `tengen/special_side` and `pure_barrier.png` both draw the barrier
as a violet-pink pane where 23C and 23F asked for translucent parchment-white.
The art is coherent with itself and keys cleanly, so it reads as a choice
rather than a slip — but `tengen.theme` is `#d6cfae`, which is what his HUD,
his install aura and his popups use, so art and fighter currently disagree
about what colour he is. Moving the theme to the violet is a one-line change to
`src/characters.js`; moving the art to parchment is a re-request of two plates.
Nobody should pick one silently.

# Round 23 — open

**Round 24's four staged fighters — Kirara Hoshi, Haruta Shigemo, Master
Tengen and Kasumi Miwa.** A separate round from 22 on purpose: 22's sets are
already being generated, and a delivery needs to say which batch it answers.
Everything about round 22B–22H's shape holds here unchanged — the kits are
live in code (`STAGED_CHARACTER_KEYS`), both workbenches list the four as
*(not on the roster yet)*, nothing blocks on this art, and the design
rationale is the round-24 section of [characters.md](characters.md).

The same two standing rules, restated so this round is self-contained:

**Absolute URLs.** This batch is expected to be generated outside the repo, so
every reference below is an absolute URL. The character blocks to use verbatim
are the `kirara`, `haruta`, `tengen` and `miwa` rows of the table above.

**The `_a` of an attack pair is the WIND-UP, and the pair has to OPEN.**
Restated here rather than left to the link, because the link is what has not
been reaching: `attack_light_a`, `attack_heavy_a`, `attack_air_a` and
`crouch_attack_a` are the coil — striking hand or weapon drawn BACK, shoulders
turned away from the target, weight on the back foot. The `_b` is the blow.

The check is one comparison, and it is between the two frames rather than
against anything else: **`_b` must reach further forward than its own `_a`, by
at least 0.05 of the fighter's standing height** — the shipped roster's median
pair opens by 0.10. Both frames are drawn at one zoom, so this needs no
placement; `python3 tools/audit_windup.py` measures every pair in the game.

Two ways round 22 broke it, and they have different fixes. Six of Yaga's and
Naoya's wind-ups were drawn about as extended as their own strikes — those need
redrawing. Kashimo's aerial pair was drawn correctly and delivered INVERTED,
the two filenames the wrong way round; that one is a swap, not a redraw.

**Work idle-first — the `idle_a` is its own delivery.** Generate each
fighter's `idle_a` alone first (plain, square-on stance per
[pose-brief.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/sprites/docs/pose-brief.md)); intake and approve it in the
sprite workbench; run `tools/build_canon_reference.py`; then generate the
other 35 poses **against that approved idle**, so costume, proportions,
palette, line weight and shading stay locked across the set. Once the idles
land on `main` they resolve at:

- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/assets/reference/canon/kirara_idle.png>
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/assets/reference/canon/haruta_idle.png>
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/assets/reference/canon/tengen_idle.png>
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoai2k/jjkbrawler/main/assets/reference/canon/miwa_idle.png>

# Round 20 — delivered

**All four requests are in.** The last of them was Yuji's own four poses, which
landed as [20E](asset-requests-history.md#20e-yujis-four-round-20-poses--4-sprites) and are in the game:
his grab now reads as a grab and his dash attack as a lunge, like everybody
else's. Nothing in round 20 is outstanding.

- **~~44 of the 114 summon plates hold six creatures instead of one~~** —
  delivered. All forty-four came back as one figure each,
  `tools/check_summon_plates.py` passes on the whole tree of 114, and the seven
  authored hit boxes that were standing in for an unmeasurable plate came out
  with them.
- **~~Twenty backgrounds, re-extended from the paintings 18E replaced~~** —
  delivered, all twenty at 3200×1800, and in the game. Each one carries its
  source painting's composition rather than a fresh take on the brief, which is
  the whole thing 18E got wrong and the only thing this round was asking for.
  See [the history entry](asset-requests-history.md#20b-twenty-backgrounds-re-extended--delivered).
- **~~The grab poses~~** and **~~the dash attack pose~~** — delivered, 26
  fighters of 27 each, plus Mahoraga. Both are in the game: every one is a new
  pose key, so nothing was replaced and nothing waited for an approval. A grab
  now reads as a grab and a dash attack as a lunge, on everybody except Yuji.
- **~~Yuji's four~~** — [20E](asset-requests-history.md#20e-yujis-four-round-20-poses--4-sprites),
  delivered. 20C and 20D each asked for 27, one per fighter, and each arrived
  as 27 files with Mahoraga in Yuji's place; this was the correction, and it
  came back as the four missing drawings. Imported, anchored, and seeded a
  pose read each — the seeder had to learn that the REFERENCE character can
  gain frames too, since it was skipping him wholesale and he was then the one
  fighter with unread art.

Round 18 is closed and everything in it landed.

**Round 18 was delivered complete** — 28 sprites and 14 near-field cards, every
section of it, plus the five render3d image inputs (DI1–DI4). Its record, and
the reasoning behind each request in it, is now in
[the history](asset-requests-history.md#round-18--delivered).

**Round 20 is the open round.** (19 is skipped as a request number: it was used
for the *intake* of round 18, so `assets/reference/round19/` holds the delivered
plates and no request ever carried that number. Reusing it would make "round 19"
mean two different things.) Anything found from here — a placement pass, an
approval rejection, a manifest audit — lands in 20 beside 20B.

## Also outstanding, but work here rather than art

Four things, and none of them is a drawing anybody owes us:

- **25 poses are waiting in the approval queue.** Round 18's sprites are in the
  repo but not in the game: each is a decision in the sprite workbench, and
  until it is made the pose keeps drawing what it drew before. This is the
  [approval step](../assets/intake/README.md#the-confirm-step) working as
  intended, not a backlog. `mechamaru/run_reach_a` is the one exception — it
  filled an empty pose rather than replacing a drawn one, so it went straight
  in and completed his run cycle.
- **The two alpha fixes** above — `hakari/dodge_air` and `toji/dodge_air` — are
  repo work on delivered files, not art anybody owes us.
- **Six variant options point at art that was retired.** `hanami_alt/` was
  folded away when the alternate-art-set machinery went ([8843a0f]) and its
  drawings moved to `assets/reference/hanami_alt/`, but six options in
  `manifest["variants"]["hanami"]` still name the old path — a chevron offering
  a file that is not there. It is also what `tools/canonicalise_sprites.py`
  refuses on, so the step that puts canonical names back on approved art cannot
  run until those six entries are dropped or repointed. Round 20's own sprites
  did not need it — a new pose key lands at its canonical name — but round 18's
  approvals do.
- **Rejections from the approval pass** will become round 20. A pose rejected
  at approval is pointed at another frame so the game keeps drawing something,
  which raises no flag; [18G](asset-requests-history.md#18g-seven-a-pose-is-drawing-somebody-elses-art--7-sprites)
  is what that costs when nobody checks, and the manifest audit that found it is
  how the count at the top of this file is now derived.
